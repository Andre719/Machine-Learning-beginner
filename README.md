# Machine-Learning-beginner
This is the first time I write codes on Machine Learning. And It is also a project of my lesson(EE369).

In this project there is the MNIST database. And I write 11 codes in all to deal with the classification. Each code stands for one way of classification. And the name of code represents the way I use in it. And you only need to run these 11 codes under the system of MATLAB 2016a or higher edition to classify the database of MNIST.

Each code need almost 10 minutes to run, and the MNIST_BP_1hidden_ReLU_SDG.m has the best result. I think you can run my code for more time and the result may be even better. Because I just run my codes looping only one epoch.

The xlxs file is my personal record about each code files in order to make comparisons between different algorithms.

These algorithms are also refer to CS231n.
